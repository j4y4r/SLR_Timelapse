SLRTimelapse v0.1

This needs some testing from my side, use it at your own risk!

Features for now:

Set time between pictures,
Hit run,
watch pictures counting up :)
 
To stop hit reset.

ToDo:
delay for Shutter low/high 
delay between Focus and Shutter


I used

+ Arduino Uno or clone
+ LCD 16x2 Keypad Shield
+ Camera with Remote Shutter option(Nikon D3100)
+ Maybe some properitary plug, i got myself something of for ebay for a few euro
