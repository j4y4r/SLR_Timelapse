SLRTimelapse v0.3

Features Added:

Number of Pictures now increase by 10
Show time left while running

Fixes & other changes:

Rearranged to Display settings after values are changed
Seconds and number of pictures now only can be zero or positive
Also changed comparison to button values, these may be different for other Shields, but i think it's more cleary that way


SLRTimelapse v0.2

Tested, working fine.

Features Added:
